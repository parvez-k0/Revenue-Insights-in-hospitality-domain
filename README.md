# Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Sector 
**Project Overview:**
In the dynamic hospitality industry, maximizing revenue requires a deep understanding of market trends, guest behavior, and operational efficiency. 
This case study focuses on analyzing critical metrics such as **occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, and realization** percentage to provide actionable insights across properties, cities, and booking platforms.

# Problem Statement and Key Metrics Required to solve the problems

## Key Challenges Identified:
•	**Inconsistent Revenue Trends:** Disparities in revenue performance across cities and room categories were evident.
•	**Weekday vs. Weekend Performance:** Weekends (Friday and Saturday) outperformed weekdays in occupancy and revenue, highlighting a need for midweek strategies.
•	**Platform Variability:** Realization percentages varied significantly across booking channels, affecting profitability.

## Approach Taken:
1.	**Organized the Data:** We gathered all the information about properties, cities, room types, and booking platforms into one place for easier analysis
2.	**Trend Analysis:** We examined how revenue and occupancy changed throughout the week, identifying when business was booming and when it was slow.
3.	**Performance Benchmarking:** We identified the properties and platforms that were doing well, so we could understand what worked and find areas for improvement.
4.	**Platform-Specific Insights:** We studied how different booking platforms affected revenue, looking at which ones generated the most bookings and which ones gave us the best value (realization percentage).

## Key Metrics and Their Importance:
1.	**No Show Rate:** Percentage of confirmed bookings where guests fail to check in. High no-show rates directly impact both revenue and operational planning.
    **Formula:** (No Shows / Total Bookings)×100\text{(No Shows / Total Bookings)} \times 100(No Shows / Total Bookings)×100.
2.	**DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** Total number of rooms occupied on a given day, reflecting demand fulfillment.
3.	**DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** Total room inventory available for sale daily. Essential for capacity planning.
4.	**ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: Measures the average revenue earned per occupied room, indicating pricing efficiency.
    **Formula**: Revenue / Number of Occupied Rooms\text{Revenue / Number of Occupied Rooms}Revenue / Number of Occupied Rooms.
5.	**DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)**: Total room nights booked per day, providing insights into booking trends.
6.	**RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** Combines occupancy and ADR to measure overall revenue performance.
    **Formula:** Revenue / Number of Available Rooms\text{Revenue / Number of Available Rooms}Revenue / Number of Available Rooms.
7.	**Realization Percentage:** Indicates revenue efficiency after accounting for cancellations, no-shows, and discounts.
    **Formula:** (Revenue Earned / Revenue Booked)×100\text{(Revenue Earned / Revenue Booked)} \times 100(Revenue Earned / Revenue Booked)×100.

## Key Findings and Insights:
1.	**Revenue by Room Class:** Luxury rooms accounted for 61.62% of total revenue, underscoring their significance but also highlighting the need to diversify offerings for mid-range and business travelers.
2.	**Weekday vs. Weekend Dynamics:** Weekends (Friday and Saturday) showed an average occupancy of 62.64%, compared to 55.85% on weekdays. This suggests potential for targeted weekday promotions to increase revenue.
3.	**Direct Booking Platforms:** Platforms with direct bookings delivered the highest realization percentage (70.6%), emphasizing the value of loyalty programs and direct engagement with guests.
4.	**Property Performance:**
        o	**Top-Performing Properties:** "Atliq City" in Mumbai generated ₹117M, showcasing strong revenue potential in the city.
        o	**Underperforming Locations:** Properties in certain cities lagged behind, requiring localized marketing efforts and dynamic pricing strategies.
5.	**Booking Channel Optimization**: OTAs showed higher volumes but lower realization percentages, pointing to the need for better negotiation or prioritizing direct bookings.

# Solutions and Impact

## Solutions to Overcome Challenges:
1.	**Dynamic Pricing:** Implement AI-driven demand forecasting to optimize ADR and balance occupancy across weekdays and weekends.
2.	**Corporate Partnerships:** Forge relationships with corporate clients to boost weekday bookings, offering discounts or customized packages.
3.	**Enhanced Guest Experience:** Introduce personalized services, such as free upgrades or loyalty perks, to improve guest retention and satisfaction.
4.	**Localized Campaigns:** For underperforming properties, invest in region-specific promotions and improve visibility on high-traffic booking platforms.
5.	**No-Show Mitigation:** Reduce no-shows by requiring prepayments or deposits and sending automated reminders to guests.

## Overall Results and Strategic Impact:
**This analysis revealed:**
•	**Revenue Growth Potential:** By focusing on weekday occupancy and leveraging direct booking platforms, properties can significantly boost revenue.
•	**Benchmarking Success**: High-performing cities like Bangalore can serve as models for replicating best practices in other regions.
•	**Optimized Resource Allocation:** Insights into platform performance and room category trends allow better resource allocation, maximizing profitability.
•	**Sustainability:** Adopting dynamic pricing and personalized marketing ensures long-term growth and customer loyalty.

# Impact:
The project provided stakeholders with a comprehensive roadmap to address key revenue challenges, optimize booking strategies, and enhance guest experiences. 
By aligning operational practices with data-driven insights, properties are now better equipped to capitalize on growth opportunities and minimize revenue leakage.
