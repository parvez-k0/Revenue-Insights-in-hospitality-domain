# Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Sector 
**Project Overview:**
In the dynamic hospitality industry, maximizing revenue requires a deep understanding of market trends, guest behavior, and operational efficiency. 
This case study focuses on analyzing critical metrics such as **occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, and realization** percentage to provide actionable insights across properties, cities, and booking platforms.

# Problem Statement and Key Metrics Required to solve the problems

## Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands owns multiple 5-Star Hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from otheer competitors and ineffective decision-making  in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a Strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. 

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Approach:
1.	**Organized the Data:** We gathered all the information about properties, cities, room types, and booking platforms into one place for easier analysis
2.	**Trend Analysis:** We examined how revenue and occupancy changed throughout the week, identifying when business was booming and when it was slow.
3.	**Performance Benchmarking:** We identified the properties and platforms that were doing well, so we could understand what worked and find areas for improvement.
4.	**Platform-Specific Insights:** We studied how different booking platforms affected revenue, looking at which ones generated the most bookings and which ones gave us the best value (realization percentage).

## Key Metrics and Their Importance:

1.	**No Show Rate:** Percentage of confirmed bookings where guests fail to check in. High no-show rates directly impact both revenue and operational planning.

   	    Formula: (No Shows / Total Bookings)×100
   
2.	**DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** Total number of rooms occupied on a given day, reflecting demand fulfillment.

3.	**DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** Total room inventory available for sale daily. Essential for capacity planning.
	
4.	**ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: Measures the average revenue earned per occupied room, indicating pricing efficiency.
   
          Formula:  Revenue / Number of Occupied Rooms
5.	**DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)**: Total room nights booked per day, providing insights into booking trends.

6.	**RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** Combines occupancy and ADR to measure overall revenue performance.
   
          Formula: Revenue / Number of Available Rooms.
   
7.	**Realization Percentage:** Indicates revenue efficiency after accounting for cancellations, no-shows, and discounts.
    
          Formula: (Revenue Earned / Revenue Booked)×100.

## Key Findings and Insights:
1.	**Revenue by Room Class:** Luxury rooms accounted for 61.62% of total revenue, underscoring their significance but also highlighting the need to diversify offerings for mid-range and business travelers.
2.	**Weekday vs. Weekend Dynamics:** Weekends **(Friday and Saturday)** showed an average occupancy of **62.64%,** compared to **55.85% on weekdays**. This suggests potential for targeted weekday promotions to increase revenue.
3.	**Direct Booking Platforms:** Platforms with **direct bookings** delivered the highest realization **percentage (70.6%)**, emphasizing the value of loyalty programs and direct engagement with guests.
4.	**Property Performance:**
        o	**Top-Performing Properties:** "Atliq City" in **Mumbai generated highest revenue followed by Banglore and Hyderabad**, showcasing strong revenue potential in the city.
        o	**Underperforming Locations:** Properties in certain cities lagged behind, requiring localized marketing efforts and dynamic pricing strategies.
5.	**Booking Channel Optimization**: OTAs showed higher volumes but lower realization percentages, pointing to the need for better negotiation or prioritizing direct bookings.

# Result
**This analysis revealed:**
•	**Revenue Growth Potential:** By focusing on weekday occupancy and leveraging direct booking platforms, properties can significantly boost revenue.

•	**Benchmarking Success**: High-performing cities like Bangalore can serve as models for replicating best practices in other regions.

•	**Optimized Resource Allocation:** Insights into platform performance and room category trends allow better resource allocation, maximizing profitability.

•	**Sustainability:** Adopting dynamic pricing and personalized marketing ensures long-term growth and customer loyalty.
