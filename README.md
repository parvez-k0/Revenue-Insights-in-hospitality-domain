# Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Sector 
**Project Overview:**
In the dynamic hospitality industry, maximizing revenue requires a deep understanding of market trends, guest behavior, and operational efficiency. 
This case study focuses on analyzing critical metrics such as **occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, and realization** percentage to provide actionable insights across properties, cities, and booking platforms.

## Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands owns multiple 5-Star Hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from otheer competitors and ineffective decision-making  in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a Strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. 

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
